# Project Name : CNN assignment to detect melanoma cancer 

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Images of different cancer are given. There are 9 clases on data
- Project is to accurately defect Melanoma cancer by training on given images
- Data has class imbalence, which needs to be addressed by data agumenting


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model was overfitted when class imbalence was not addressed. It was not performing well on unseen data
- Data agumenting to handle class imbalence helped to overcome model overfitting
- After data agumenting model performance increase a lot on unseen data
